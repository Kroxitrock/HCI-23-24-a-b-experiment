  <h1>Human-Computer Interaction experiment</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, and thank you for participating in this experiment. It is conducted
    for the purposes of the "Evaluation of Interactive Systems" course which is
    part of the Human-Computer Interaction and Design program at Universidad
    Polit√©cnica de Madrid.
  </p>
  <p>
    The experiment that you would be taking part of consists of 6 stages. In
    each stage you would be asked to select an item from a list of 50 items.
    After you successfully selected the item, another one would be randomly
    assigned to you. For half of the stages, the size of the objects will be
    bigger and for the rest it will be smaller. The order in which the scale is
    changed will be random. Please conduct the experiment only on a PC or Laptop
    and don't use the keyboard during the experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you conlcude the experiment, you will be redirected to a page on which
    you will be able to download the results of the experiment. We would ask you
    to send us those results. In the results there is no data about you as a
    person, and there is no way to identify you from the data. The parameters we
    collect are your speed and number of errors, so we would ask you to complete
    the experiment as effectively as possible.
